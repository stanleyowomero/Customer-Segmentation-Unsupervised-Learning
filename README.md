Customer segmentation is simply a way of arranging your customers into smaller groups/segment according to certain characteristics/attribute. In oorder to target specific, relevant marketing messages at each group.

The Original data set is from the Kaggle 'Online Retail Data Set II' provided by UCL.

This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
